# ðŸ¤– HT-AI-Playground

Welcome to **HT-AI-Playground** â€” a curated lab where I collaborate with ChatGPT to design, build, and refine BIM automation tools, UI systems, and Revit-based workflows.

This repo acts as my **AI-powered dev vault** â€” documenting everything from tool blueprints to memory snapshots, learning progress, and future experiments.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

- Archive my ChatGPT memory exports and learning tracks
- Document the evolution of tools built with AI guidance
- Store structured roadmaps, designs, and iteration logs
- Reflect on how AI helps power NodeForge and HT-Toolbox
