# 🤖 HT-AI-Playground

Welcome to **HT-AI-Playground** — a curated lab where I collaborate with ChatGPT to design, build, and refine BIM automation tools, UI systems, and Revit-based workflows.

This repo acts as my **AI-powered dev vault** — documenting everything from tool blueprints to memory snapshots, learning progress, and future experiments.

This is my personal AI assistant prompt library — a growing vault of advanced ChatGPT prompts tailored for:

- 🏗️ Revit API / pyRevit / Dynamo
- 🐍 Python scripting & GUI
- 💼 GitHub portfolio & branding
- 💡 Weekly LinkedIn post ideas

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Archive my ChatGPT memory exports and learning tracks
- Document the evolution of tools built with AI guidance
- Store structured roadmaps, designs, and iteration logs
- Reflect on how AI helps power NodeForge and HT-Toolbox
